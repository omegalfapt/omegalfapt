- 👋 Hi, I’m @omegalfapt aka omegalfa
- 👀 I’m interested in the Philips CD-i system
- 🌱 I’m thinking in learning C programming to finally understand  most of the people on earth!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any CD-i lovers!
- 📫 You can reach me by email: omegalfa@theworldofcdi.com 
I run The World of CD-i website (www.theworldofcdi.com) and want to complete the site database with all the Philips CD-i titles ever published.
